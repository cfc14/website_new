#### Shankruth Balasubramaniyam-Robotics researcher
I am Shankruth, a robotics enthusiast and researcher, currently pursuing my passion for creating innovative solutions in robotics. My journey is inspired by a vision to solve real-world challenges through intelligent systems, particularly in dynamic environments like maritime settings and multi-agent robotics.

### Highlights of My Work
- **Autonomous Maritime Systems:** Developed multi-agent ASV systems for harbor protection, using deep reinforcement learning to enhance pursuit-evasion strategies.
- **Bio-inspired Robotics:** Contributed to the Eigenbot project at Carnegie Mellonâ€™s Biorobotics Lab, focusing on decentralized reinforcement learning for stable gait generation in bio-inspired robots.
- **Computer Vision:** Collaborated with the University of Washington on object detection algorithms for identifying foreign object debris in fuel tanks, utilizing four-channel RGBD input for anomaly detection.

My primary focus is on bridging the gap between theoretical research and deployable robotics solutions, making a positive impact on lives through technology.

### Key Research Themes
- **Machine Learning for Robotics:** Developed reinforcement learning algorithms for complex, multi-agent environments, focusing on robust decision-making and adaptability.
- **Bio-inspired Robotics:** Exploring decentralized control methods for multi-legged robots, with an emphasis on adaptive gait patterns and stability in unstructured environments.
- **Computer Vision:** Implemented advanced object detection models for industrial applications, focusing on anomaly detection and safety enhancement.
